# MOCI - Met Office Coupling Infrastructure

The Met Office global coupled models (GC) couple together the ​
[UM](https://github.com/MetOffice/um) and [​NEMO](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/) in
order to create an atmosphere-ocean-ice-land modelling system of the physical
climate model. Moci is also used in the NGMS infrastructure, using
[LFRic](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps) as the atmosphere model.

The Met Office Coupling Infrastructure (MOCI) is a repository of codes that,
together with ​Rose suites, form the superstructure controlling the execution of
Met Office global coupled models components.

#### Testing

MOCI rose-stem provides testing for the Coupled_Drivers and Postprocessing applications plus Utilities unittests.
`cylc vip -z group=<group> -n <run name> <path to rose-stem dir>`

Available test groups:
`all`       Runs all available tasks
`tests`     Runs all unit tests covering MOCI code
`postproc`  Runs all Postprocessing application tasks
`drivers`   Runs all Coupled_Drivers related tasks.
            Drivers run tasks currently only available on Met Office internal machines.
            `drivers_non_run` tests are available on other platforms
