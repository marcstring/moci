DESCRIPTION
    Module containing error codes for the drivers. To ensure consistancy over
    all the scripts that will make up the drivers, it is recommended that the
    follwing error codes be used for self consistancy. Any error codes <100
    are to be used within the drivers themselves, for specific errors.
